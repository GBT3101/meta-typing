// Helper function that takes an array of arrays and reverses each of the inner arrays.
//
// Notice that the function is implemented with an object and a ternary check that accesses
// one of its properties:
//
// {
//   0: A;
//   1: B;
// }[T extends H ? 0 : 1]
//
// This is the same as writing: `T extends H ? A : B`. If the condition is true then
// `A` is returned because it's referenced by the `0` key. Otherwise it's `B` that's returned
// since it's referenced by the `1` key.
//
// TypScript's type system doesn't support recursive types and the above example is a way
// of going around it. Please note that it's not something TypeScript officially supports:
// https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/26223#issuecomment-513187373.

  // since we add elements into it in a reversed order.
