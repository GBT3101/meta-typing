> ðŸ—ž Writting Lodash's functionality with TypeScript's type system

### Introduction

TypeScript's type system is a programming language that runs when we compile our code. Normally, we use it to annotate our code so TypeScript can help us find bugs before we run it. In this project however, I tried to push TypeScript's type system to its limits by implementing many of Lodash's functionality, purely on the shoulders of the type system.

The goal of this project is educational and humoristic. Because TypeScript's type system has [some limts](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/28663) and missing some functionality I had to solve some problems in creative and hacky ways.
