> Writing Lodash's functions with TypeScript's type system

### Introduction

[TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript)'s type system is a programming language that runs when we compile our code. Normally, we use it to annotate our code so TypeScript can help us find bugs before we run it. In this project, however, I tried to push TypeScript's type system to its limits by implementing many of [Lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash)'s functions, purely on the shoulders of the type system.

The goal of this project is educational and humoristic. I used recursion a lot and had to find creative solutions to overcome [some of the limitations](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/28663) of the type system. Even though I tried, it's impossible to implement a handful of functions until [several features are implemented](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/1213) in TypeScript.

Just to see how far I can go I tried implementing the classical [Eight queens puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle). I'm still shocked it actually works, [you have to check it out]().

### Nice! Where's the code?

Every function has its own folder inside the [src]() folder. In each folder, you will find the function implementation and a test file for that function.

I added comments to each function's code to explain what's going on.

### Run the code locally

Start by installing dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

Open a file of any function and hover over the types to see the results of "running" that function with some input.

You can also run the tests with:

```
$ npm test
```
